## Autonomous Workflows

### Feature Development Pipeline
```typescript
interface AutonomousFeatureWorkflow {
  // Phase 1: Planning and Architecture
  planning: {
    requirement_analysis: "Parse and validate feature requirements";
    epic_breakdown: "Split into testable, implementable tasks";
    architecture_design: "Design schema, API, and component architecture";
    risk_assessment: "Identify potential issues and mitigation strategies";
  };
  
  // Phase 2: Implementation with Continuous Validation
  implementation: {
    schema_creation: "Design and optimize database schema";
    function_generation: "Create type-safe API functions";
    component_development: "Build real-time React components";
    integration_testing: "Validate cross-layer compatibility";
  };
  
  // Phase 3: Comprehensive Validation
