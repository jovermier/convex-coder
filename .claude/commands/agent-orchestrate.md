# Agent Orchestrate Command

Delegates complex full-stack epic coordination to the Orchestrator agent for autonomous implementation.

## Usage
```
@agent-orchestrate <epic-name> <description>
```

## Examples
```
@agent-orchestrate "e-commerce-platform" "Complete shopping cart with payment processing and inventory management"
@agent-orchestrate "real-time-chat" "Multi-room chat system with file sharing and user presence"
@agent-orchestrate "admin-dashboard" "Comprehensive admin interface with analytics and user management"
@agent-orchestrate "content-management" "CMS with rich text editing, media library, and publishing workflow"
```

## Agent Delegation

The Orchestrator agent autonomously handles:
- Epic breakdown into full-stack tasks
- Specialist agent assignment and coordination  
- Implementation validation and testing
- Quality assurance and performance optimization
- Issue detection and autonomous retry mechanisms

## Success Criteria

The Orchestrator agent ensures:
- All epic requirements are fully implemented and validated
- Full-stack integration works seamlessly end-to-end  
- Performance meets or exceeds established benchmarks
- All tests pass across frontend, backend, and integration layers
- Documentation is complete and up-to-date

All coordination patterns, escalation triggers, communication protocols, and monitoring are handled autonomously by the agents rather than the command.
