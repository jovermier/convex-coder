# Claude Code Commands - Convex Full-Stack Development

Autonomous agent system commands for comprehensive full-stack feature development with validation loops.

## ðŸŒŸ **START HERE: Primary Command**

### **`@feature-complete` - Your Go-To Command**
**Use this for 90% of development requests.** This is the main command developers should use for any feature work.

- âœ… Takes features from concept to fully validated completion across the entire stack
- âœ… Works autonomously until feature is fully working, tested, and verified  
- âœ… Includes comprehensive validation across schema, functions, and components
- âœ… Automatically retries up to 5 times if issues are found
- âœ… Self-healing with intelligent issue detection and resolution

**When to use:** Almost always - for new features, improvements, bug fixes, or any development work.

```bash
@feature-complete user-dashboard "Users can view their profile" "Dashboard shows user activity"
@feature-complete task-management "Create, edit, delete tasks" "Real-time updates"  
@feature-complete auth-system "OAuth login with Google/GitHub" "User roles and permissions"
```

---

## ðŸ”§ **Specialized Commands** 
*Use these only for specific scenarios:*

### **`@agent-orchestrate`** - Multi-System Features
**When to use:** Complex features requiring multiple specialist agents (schema + backend + frontend + auth + etc.)
```bash
@agent-orchestrate "e-commerce-platform" "Complete shopping cart with payment processing and inventory"
```

### **`@test-comprehensive`** - Testing Only  
**When to use:** You just want testing/validation of existing code without changes
```bash
@test-comprehensive --fix-issues
```

### **`@performance-audit`** - Performance Analysis
**When to use:** You need performance analysis, optimization, and monitoring setup
```bash
@performance-audit --optimize --monitor
```

### **`@schema-migrate`** - Database Changes
**When to use:** You need to modify existing schemas with proper migration strategies
```bash
@schema-migrate user-profiles "Add social media links and preferences"
```

### **`@health-check`** - System Diagnostics
**When to use:** System maintenance, diagnostics, or investigating issues
```bash
@health-check --deep --auto-fix
```

## ðŸš€ **Decision Tree: Which Command Should I Use?**

```
Is this a development request (new feature, improvement, bug fix)?
â”œâ”€ YES â†’ Use @feature-complete (90% of cases)
â””â”€ NO â†’ Is this...
    â”œâ”€ Complex multi-system epic? â†’ @agent-orchestrate
    â”œâ”€ Testing existing code only? â†’ @test-comprehensive  
    â”œâ”€ Performance optimization needed? â†’ @performance-audit
    â”œâ”€ Schema changes required? â†’ @schema-migrate
    â””â”€ System diagnostics needed? â†’ @health-check
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Common Usage Patterns**

### Typical Developer Workflow
```bash
# 1. Most common - develop any feature
@feature-complete user-dashboard "Users can view their profile" "Dashboard shows user activity"

# 2. For complex multi-system features  
@agent-orchestrate "e-commerce-platform" "Complete shopping cart with payment processing"

# 3. Periodic system maintenance
@health-check --deep --auto-fix
```

### Testing & Validation Only
```bash
# Test existing code without changes
@test-comprehensive --fix-issues

# Performance analysis and optimization  
@performance-audit --optimize --monitor

# Schema changes with migration
@schema-migrate user-profiles "Add social media links"
```

## Autonomous Full-Stack Workflows

### Feature Development Pipeline
1. **`@feature-complete`** - End-to-end autonomous implementation
   - Schema design and optimization
   - Function generation with type safety
   - Component creation with real-time integration
   - Authentication integration if needed
   - Comprehensive testing and validation

2. **Automatic Validation Phases**:
   - **Functional**: Requirement verification and user workflow validation
   - **Integration**: Schema, functions, and components work together seamlessly  
   - **Performance**: Query performance, bundle size, page load times
   - **Type Safety**: No TypeScript errors across the stack
   - **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and usability standards
   - **Cross-Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility

### Multi-Agent Coordination
1. **`@agent-orchestrate`** - Epic breakdown and task assignment
2. **Automatic agent coordination** - Parallel implementation with validation
   - **Schema Manager** â†’ Database design and optimization
   - **Function Generator** â†’ API layer with authentication
   - **React Builder** â†’ Components with real-time updates
   - **Auth Specialist** â†’ Authentication and authorization
   - **Performance Engineer** â†’ Optimization and monitoring
3. **Integration testing** - Cross-system compatibility verification
4. **Performance validation** - Load testing and optimization
